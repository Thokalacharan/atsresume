This is exactly what recruiters look for and makes your impact clear.\n",

            "3.  **Relevant Technical Skills:** A good mix of programming languages, web technologies, backend/cloud tools, and fundamental CS knowledge.\n",
            "4.  **Well-Described Project:** Your \"Sports Scheduler\" project is detailed, uses a relevant tech stack (React, Tailwind, MongoDB), and showcases full-stack capabilities, authentication, and responsive design.\n",
            "5.  **Clear Education Section:** All necessary information is present and easy to read.\n",

            "        *   If these experiences are *past*, update the years to reflect that (e.g., Dec 2023 – Feb 2024).\n",

            "        *   If these are *upcoming* internships/trainings, you should either:\n",

If it involved substantial project work, keep it but ensure the dates are fixed.\n",
